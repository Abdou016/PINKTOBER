 # README: Data Preprocessing and Machine Learning for Survival Prediction

This notebook is structured to preprocess a medical dataset and train a machine learning model for predicting patient survival status. The notebook consists of several stages: data loading, preprocessing, model creation, training, evaluation, and test prediction. Below is a step-by-step description of each section.

## 1. Data Loading and Initial Exploration

- **Libraries Imported**:
  - Essential libraries such as `pandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`, and `seaborn` are imported for data manipulation and visualization.
  - Machine learning libraries such as `scikit-learn` and `keras` are used for modeling.
  
- **Loading the Dataset**:
  - The training and test datasets are loaded using `pandas.read_csv()` into DataFrames named `train_dataset` and `test_dataset`.
  
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
  - The initial data exploration checks the shape of the datasets (number of rows and columns), data types, and the presence of missing values.
  - This step helps identify data quality issues and understand the dataset structure.

## 2. Data Preprocessing

- **Handling Missing Values**:
  - Any missing values in the dataset are identified and imputed where necessary. For instance, numeric columns might be filled using the mean, median, or a specific value, while categorical columns could use the most frequent category.

- **Feature Engineering**:
  - This step involves creating new features or modifying existing ones to improve model performance. Examples could include encoding categorical variables, creating interaction terms, or normalizing numerical features.
  
- **Encoding Categorical Variables**:
  - Categorical features are converted to numeric representations using techniques like one-hot encoding or label encoding.
  
- **Splitting the Data**:
  - The original training dataset is split into features (`X`) and the target label (`y`), where `y` represents the survival status.
  - A further split is made to create training and validation sets (`X_train_split`, `y_train_split`, `X_val`, `y_val`). This ensures that model performance can be evaluated on data that was not used during training.

## 3. Machine Learning Model Creation

- **Neural Network Definition**:
  - A deep learning model is built using Keras' Sequential API. The architecture consists of several layers:
    - Input layer: Takes in the preprocessed features.
    - Hidden layers: Multiple Dense layers with ReLU activation functions, Batch Normalization to stabilize training, and Dropout for regularization.
    - Output layer: A single neuron with a sigmoid activation function to output a probability between 0 and 1 (binary classification).

- **Model Compilation**:
  - The model is compiled using the Adam optimizer, which adjusts the learning rate during training.
  - The loss function used is `binary_crossentropy`, suitable for binary classification tasks.
  - The metric used for evaluation during training is `accuracy`.

## 4. Training the Model

- **Setting Up Callbacks**:
  - Early stopping is used to terminate training when the validation loss stops improving for a set number of epochs, avoiding overfitting.
  - ReduceLROnPlateau reduces the learning rate if the validation loss plateaus, allowing the model to converge better.

- **Model Fitting**:
  - The model is trained on the training data (`X_train_split`, `y_train_split`) and validated on the validation set (`X_val`, `y_val`).
  - The training process runs for up to 100 epochs, with a batch size of 32, but can stop earlier based on the early stopping criteria.

## 5. Model Evaluation

- **Validation Predictions**:
  - The trained model predicts survival probabilities on the validation set, and these probabilities are converted to binary predictions based on a threshold of 0.5.
  
- **Evaluation Metrics**:
  - `accuracy_score` measures the proportion of correct predictions.
  - A classification report is generated, showing precision, recall, F1-score, and support for each class.
  
- **Confusion Matrix Visualization**:
  - A heatmap of the confusion matrix is plotted using `seaborn`, providing insight into the types of errors made by the model (false positives, false negatives).

## 6. Test Predictions and Submission File Creation

- **Making Predictions on the Test Set**:
  - The model generates predictions for the test dataset, which are then converted to binary outcomes based on a threshold of 0.5.

- **Submission Preparation**:
  - A DataFrame is created containing the `Patient_ID` and the predicted `Survival_Status`.
  - The DataFrame is saved as a CSV file (`submission_nn_optimized.csv`) for submission or further analysis.

## 7. Additional Steps (Optional)

- **Hyperparameter Tuning**:
  - Hyperparameters such as the number of layers, number of neurons in each layer, dropout rate, and learning rate can be tuned to improve model performance.
  
- **Ensemble Methods**:
  - Combining predictions from multiple models (e.g., neural networks, decision trees, etc.) can be used to boost accuracy.
