README: Breast Cancer Classification
Purpose
This script demonstrates a machine learning approach to classify breast cancer data using Logistic Regression.

Workflow
Data Loading: Loads training and test data.
Data Preprocessing:
Drops unnecessary columns.
Encodes categorical labels.
Normalizes numerical features.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Analyzes correlations between features.
Model Training: Trains a Logistic Regression model using cross-validation.
Prediction: Predicts class labels for the test data.
Submission: Creates a submission file in the required format.
Libraries
numpy: Numerical computations
pandas: Data manipulation
matplotlib.pyplot: Visualization
seaborn: Statistical visualizations
sklearn: Machine learning tools (preprocessing, models, evaluation)
Usage
Replace "train.csv" and "test.csv" with your actual file paths.
Run the script.
The submission file (submission.csv) will be generated.
Notes
Adjust hyperparameters and preprocessing steps as needed.
Consider using other classification algorithms (e.g., Decision Trees, Random Forests).
Evaluate model performance using appropriate metrics (e.g., accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score).
