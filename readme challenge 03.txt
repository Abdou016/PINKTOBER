README:Survival Sentinel
This project aims to develop machine learning models that predict the likelihood of survival for breast cancer patients based on historical patient data.
The models will be trained using health indicators and outcomes from real-world datasets to provide insights that can assist in patient prognosis and treatment planning.
By analyzing various health features, such as age, tumor characteristics, treatment details, and other relevant factors,the models will help identify patterns 
that correlate with survival outcomes.
